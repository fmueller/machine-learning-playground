- show recall and precision by homewin, draw and awaywin
- try other learning algorithms: svm, logistic regression
- try adaboost
- safe computed features and load them afterwards from disk
- investigate if feature for date makes sense: maybe home win ratio for matches in this month / season
- output data of experiment to csv file (prediction for each match, neural network performance evaluation data)
- add data set from transfermarkt
- test if last 6 matches, last 3 matches and last match improves performance
