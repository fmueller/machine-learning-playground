- add head-to-head feature
- add matchstatistics feature (number of wins, draws, losts and home wins, home draws, home losts, away wins, away draws, away losts)
- safe computed features and load them afterwards from disk
- try other learning algorithms: svm, logistic regression
- add data set from transfermarkt
- test if last 6 matches, last 3 matches and last match improves performance
- output data of experiment to csv file (prediction for each match, neural network performance evaluation data)
