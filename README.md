machine-learning-playground
===========================

This project is used as my own playground for machine learning where I put small snippets and example projects to test something interesting for me.

- soccer-national-prediction: prediction of matches between national soccer teams, done with Groovy and Encog
- wmprediction: graphs with R for soccer data set
